### Purpose  
Enable users to quickly and efficiently find movies by entering full or partial movie titles, with real-time suggestions and optional advanced search filters.


---


### 1. Search by Movie Title


- Users can enter a full or partial movie title in the search input field.
- The system returns a list of matching movies based on the entered text.
- Search is case-insensitive and ignores diacritics (e.g., accents in Vietnamese).
- The search supports partial matches anywhere in the movie title.


---


### 2. Autocomplete / Suggestion


- While the user types, the system displays a dropdown list of suggested movies matching the input.
- Each suggestion includes:
  - A small movie poster thumbnail.
  - Movie title.
  - Release year.
- Suggestions update dynamically as the user continues typing.
- Users can select a suggestion to navigate directly to the movie detail page.

### 3. Advanced Search (Optional)


- Users can refine their search using additional filters integrated into an advanced search panel or filter section.
- Available filters include:
  - Genre
  - Actor
  - Director
  - Release Year

### 4. Search Results Display

  - Movie poster
  - Title
  - Release year
- If no movies match the search criteria, display a clear message:  
  "No movies found matching your search."
