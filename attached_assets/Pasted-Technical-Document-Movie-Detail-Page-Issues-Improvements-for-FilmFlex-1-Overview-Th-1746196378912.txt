Technical Document: Movie Detail Page Issues & Improvements for FilmFlex


## 1. Overview


The Movie Detail page currently exhibits several user experience and technical issues that negatively impact movie viewing and interaction. This document details the identified problems, root causes, and recommended solutions to improve product quality.

## 2. Identified Issues


### 2.1. Video Player Interaction Issues


- **Symptom:** Users cannot click the Play button or interact with the video player.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The video player may be overlaid by other UI elements (CSS z-index, hidden layers).
  - Click events are blocked or not properly propagated to the player.
  - The player is not properly initialized or lacks a valid video source.
- **Impact:** Users cannot start watching movies, degrading the experience.


### 2.2. Episodes Section Logic & UI


- **Symptom:** The Episodes section displays the video player directly instead of a list of episodes.
- **Root Cause:**
  - UI does not clearly separate the video player from the episode list.
  - When multiple episodes exist, the UI does not render episode buttons or tabs.
  - For single-episode (full) movies, the episode section still tries to display episodes, causing confusion.
- **Impact:** Cluttered interface and poor user experience.


### 2.3. Incorrect or Missing Data Display


- **Symptom:** Fields like Release Year show invalid values (e.g., "0aa9").
- **Root Cause:**
  - API returns malformed or missing data.
  - Frontend does not validate or provide fallback handling for invalid data.
- **Impact:** Reduces trust and negatively affects user experience.


### 2.4. Missing User and Admin Login Flow


- **Symptom:** No implemented login system or role-based access control for users and admins.
- **Impact:** Cannot personalize user experience or manage content and comments effectively.


### 2.5. Additional Minor UI/UX Issues


- Sections like Recommended For You and More Like This may lack data or show unclear placeholders.
- Comments section lacks pagination or efficient lazy loading.
- Interaction buttons (Share, Add to List, Report) lack clear feedback on user clicks.

## 3. Technical Requirements & Tasks


### 3.1. Fix Video Player Interaction


- Review and adjust CSS:
  - Ensure the video player has a higher z-index than other layers.
  - Remove any `pointer-events: none` styles on the player or parent elements.
- Ensure the player is mounted only once.
- Load valid video sources from the API.
- Add event listeners on the Play button with debugging logs.


### 3.2. Refactor Episodes UI


- Separate VideoPlayer and EpisodesList into distinct components.
- EpisodesList should display episode buttons or tabs only.
- Selecting an episode updates the video player source.
- Hide EpisodesList for single-episode movies and display a "Full Movie" label.
- Example component structure:
  ```
  <VideoPlayer src={selectedEpisode.link_embed} />
  <EpisodesList episodes={episodes} onSelect={setSelectedEpisode} />
  ```


### 3.3. Validate and Sanitize Data Before Rendering


- Add validation for API data:
  - Show "Unknown" if Release Year is invalid.
  - Show "Updating" if Director field is empty.
- Implement helper functions for fallback data handling.
- Ensure important fields never display broken or invalid data.


### 3.4. Design and Implement Login Flow


- Build login UI for both users and admins.
- Backend API for authentication returning JWT tokens.
- Frontend stores tokens and manages login state.
- Implement role-based access control for admin dashboard.
- Support logout and token security.
- Integrate login/logout with existing UI (header, user menu).


### 3.5. Improve Supporting UI/UX


- Show clear data or placeholders in Recommended For You and More Like This sections.
- Add pagination or lazy loading for Comments.
- Provide user feedback on button interactions (loading spinners, toast notifications).
- Optimize responsiveness of video player and episode list components.

## 5. Notes for AI Implementation


- Use React or Vue to refactor components.
- Use state management to track current episode playing.
- Use CSS modules or Tailwind to avoid style conflicts.
- Handle API errors and loading states gracefully.
- Secure tokens and enforce backend authorization.
