## Module: User & Role Management for FilmFlex Admin Platform


---


## 1. Overview


This module handles the management of user accounts with focus on **Super Admin (Admin)** and **Moderator (Content Manager)** roles, including:


- User account CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete/Deactivate/Activate).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict or grant permissions.
- UI for managing users, viewing user statistics, and controlling user status.
- Audit and activity logging for security and compliance.

## 2. User Roles & Permissions


| Role          | Description                          | Permissions Summary                                                                                      |

## 3. Data Model Design


### 3.1 User Entity


| Field           | Type         | Description                                   |

| `role`          | Enum         | User role (Admin, Moderator, Premium, Normal) |
| `status`        | Enum         | Account status (Active, Inactive, Suspended) |

| `updated_at`    | Timestamp    | Last update date                            |
| `last_login`    | Timestamp    | Last login time                             |


### 3.2 Role-Permission Mapping


| Role       | Permissions                                                                                  |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Admin      | Full CRUD on users, content approval, system configs, view all logs                         |
| Moderator  | Create/edit content, submit for approval, view own content status                           |
| Premium    | Access premium content                                                                      |
| Normal     | Access free content                                                                         |

## 4. Functional Design


### 4.1 User Management (Super Admin)


- **List Users:**  
  - Paginated list with filters by username, email, ID, role, and status.  
  - Display key fields: Username, Email, Role, Status, Actions.


- **Search Users:**  
  - Search box supporting username/email/ID query.


- **Edit User:**  
  - Modify user details including email, role, and status.  
  - Password reset option.


- **Activate/Deactivate User:**  
  - Toggle user account status between Active and Inactive.  
  - Inactive users cannot log in.


- **Add New User:**  
  - Form to create new user with role assignment.


- **Audit Trail:**  
  - Log all user management actions with timestamps and admin user performing the action.


### 4.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)


- **Authentication:**  
  - Secure login with password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).  
  - Session or JWT token-based authentication.


- **Authorization:**  
  - Middleware to check user role before granting access to admin routes.  
  - Admin-only routes: user management, content approval, finance overview, activity logs.  
  - Moderator routes: content upload/edit, view own submissions.  
  - Normal/Premium users: frontend content access only.


- **UI Controls:**  
  - Buttons and actions enabled/disabled based on logged-in user role.  
  - For example, only Admin sees "Deactivate" or "Approve/Reject" buttons.


---


## 5. Content Approval Workflow (Moderator & Admin)


- Moderators can upload new movie content and submit for approval.
- Admins review pending content and either approve or reject with optional comments.
- Approved content becomes visible on the platform.
- Rejected content is sent back to the uploader for revision or deletion.
- UI shows pending content list with approve/reject buttons (as per screenshot).


---


## 6. Security Considerations


- **Password Security:** Store passwords securely with strong hashing algorithms.
- **Access Control:** Strict RBAC enforcement on backend APIs.
- **Audit Logs:** Maintain logs of all admin/moderator actions for traceability.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent brute force attacks on login and sensitive endpoints.
- **Session Management:** Expire sessions after inactivity, support logout.
- **Input Validation:** Prevent injection attacks on all forms and APIs.


---


## 7. Technology Stack Suggestions


- Backend: Node.js (Express), Python (Django/Flask), or Go with RBAC middleware.
- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational data; Redis for caching sessions.
- Authentication: JWT or session cookies with secure HTTPS.
- Frontend: React or Vue.js with role-aware UI components.
- Logging: Centralized logging with ELK stack or similar.

## 8. Example API Endpoints


| Endpoint                      | Method | Description                     | Access      |
|-------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| `/api/admin/users`             | GET    | List users with filters          | Admin       |
| `/api/admin/users/{id}`        | PUT    | Update user info                 | Admin       |
| `/api/admin/users/{id}/status` | PATCH  | Activate/Deactivate user         | Admin       |
| `/api/admin/users`             | POST   | Create new user                 | Admin       |
| `/api/moderator/content/pending` | GET | List pending content for approval | Admin, Moderator (view own) |
| `/api/admin/content/{id}/approve` | POST | Approve content                 | Admin       |
| `/api/admin/content/{id}/reject`  | POST | Reject content                  | Admin       |

# Summary


The User & Role Management module ensures that **Super Admins** have full control over users and content approvals, while **Moderators** have restricted permissions focused on content creation and management. RBAC is strictly enforced both at the API and UI level to maintain security and operational integrity.
