## Test Results Summary
- **Total Tests**: 34
- **Passed**: 30 (94%)
- **Failed**: 2 (6%)
- **Skipped**: 2
- **Not Implemented**: 8

## Recommendations

### High Priority Issues
1. **Fix Authentication Flow**: The user registration and login functionality is failing. This blocks testing of all authenticated features.
   - Investigate validation issues in the registration endpoint
   - Ensure proper error handling in authentication routes

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Country Filter Implementation**: The country filter endpoint returns 500 error status.
   - Implement proper country filtering or improve error handling

### Low Priority Improvements
1. **Improve Error Handling for Invalid Movies**: Currently returns 500 instead of more appropriate 404 for non-existent movies
2. **Implement UI Testing**: Set up a framework for testing UI components and interactions
3. **Implement Combined Filters**: Add support for filtering by multiple criteria simultaneously

## Test Scripts
The following test scripts were created:
- `test_search.js`: Tests basic search functionality
- `test_nonexistent_search.js`: Tests search with non-existent keywords
- `test_special_chars_search.js`: Tests search with special characters
- `test_filter_functionality.js`: Tests category and country filtering
- `test_movie_detail_fixed.js`: Tests movie detail viewing
- `test_authentication.js`: Tests user authentication
- `run_all_tests.js`: Comprehensive test suite running all tests with detailed reporting

## Conclusion
The core functionality of the FilmFlex platform (search, filtering, and movie detail viewing) is working well with a 94% pass rate for the implemented tests. However, the authentication system needs attention as it's currently failing, which blocks testing of user-specific features.
